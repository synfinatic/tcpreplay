tcpreplay is a tool for replaying network traffic from files saved with
tcpdump or other tools which write pcap(3) files.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page briefly documents the \fBtcpreplay-edit\fP command.
The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend  all  packets  from  the
input file(s) at the speed at which they were recorded, or a specified 
data rate, up to as fast as the hardware is capable.

Optionally, the traffic can be split between two interfaces, written to
files, filtered and edited in various ways, providing the means to test
firewalls, NIDS and other network devices.

For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at:

.SH OPTIONS
.SS ""
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIstring\fP, " \--portmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.
This option may appear up to \-1 times.
.sp
Specify a list of comma delimited port mappingings consisting of
colon delimited port number pairs.  Each colon delimited port pair
consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.

Examples:
.nf
    \--portmap=80:8000 \--portmap=8080:80    # 80->8000 and 8080->80
    \--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
    \--portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80
.fi
.TP
.BR \-s " \fInumber\fP, " \--seed "=" \fInumber\fP
Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo 
randomized but still maintain client/server relationships.
Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed, 
you can reuse the same seed value to recreate the traffic.
.TP
.BR \-N " \fIstring\fP, " \--pnat "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 2 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
srcipmap.
.sp
Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR
netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated in order against
the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the
first netblock, it is rewriten using the second netblock as a
mask against the high order bits.

IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-S " \fIstring\fP, " \--srcipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite source IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the source IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-D " \fIstring\fP, " \--dstipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the destination IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-e " \fIstring\fP, " \--endpoints "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
Takes a pair of colon delimited IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite
all traffic to appear to be between the two IP addresses.

IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=172.16.0.1:172.16.0.2
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=[2001:db8::dead:beef]:[::ffff:0:0:ac:f:0:2]
.fi

.TP
.BR \-b ", " \--skipbroadcast
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.

will keep broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \--fixcsum
Force recalculation of IPv4/TCP/UDP header checksums.
.sp
Causes each IPv4/v6 packet to have their checksums recalcualted and
fixed.  Automatically enabled for packets modified with \fB--seed\fP, 
\fB--pnat\fP, \fB--endpoints\fP or \fB--fixlen\fP.
.TP
.BR \-m " \fInumber\fP, " \--mtu "=" \fInumber\fP

no larger then the MTU.
.TP
.BR \-E ", " \--efcs
Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.
.sp
Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS
actually exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence,
you should only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS when 
reading raw packets.
.TP
.BR \--ttl "=\fIstring\fP"

This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp

.TP
.BR \-A " \fIstring\fP, " \--decode "=" \fIstring\fP
Arguments passed to tcpdump decoder.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
verbose.
.sp
When enabling verbose mode (\fB-v\fP) you may also specify one or more
additional  arguments to pass to \fBtcpdump\fP to modify the way packets
are decoded.  By default, \-n and \-l are used.   Be  sure  to
quote the arguments like: \-A "-axxx" so that they are not interpreted
by tcpreplay.   Please see the tcpdump(1) man page for a complete list of 
options.
.TP
.BR \-K ", " \--enable-file-cache
Enable caching of packets to internal memory.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
loop.
.sp
Cache pcap file(s) the first time they are cached in RAM so that subsequent
loops do not incurr any disk I/O latency in order to increase performance.  Make 
sure you have enough free RAM to store the entire pcap file(s) in memory or the
system will swap and performance will suffer.
.TP
.BR \--preload-pcap
Preloads packets into RAM before sending.
.sp
This option loads the specified pcap(s) into RAM before starting to send in order
to improve replay performance while introducing a startup performance hit.
Preloading can be used with or without \fB--loop\fP and implies 
\fB--enable-file-cache\fP.
.TP
.BR \-c " \fIstring\fP, " \--cachefile "=" \fIstring\fP
Split traffic via a tcpprep cache file.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
intf2.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
dualfile.
.sp
If you have a pcap file you would like to use to send bi-directional
traffic through a device (firewall, router, IDS, etc) then using tcpprep
you can create a cachefile which tcpreplay will use to split the traffic
across two network interfaces.
.TP
.BR \-2 ", " \--dualfile
Replay two files at a time from a network tap.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
intf2.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
If you captured network traffic using a network tap, then you can end up with
two pcap files- one for each direction.  This option will replay two these two
files at the same time, one on each interface and inter-mix them using the 
timestamps in each.
.TP
.BR \-i " \fIstring\fP, " \--intf1 "=" \fIstring\fP
Server/primary traffic output interface.
This option may appear up to 1 times.

.ti +4
 1
.sp

.TP
.BR \--pktlen
Override the snaplen and use the actual packet len.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
By default, tcpreplay will send packets based on the size of the "snaplen"
stored in the pcap file which is usually the correct thing to do.  However,
occasionally, tools will store more bytes then told to.  By specifying this
option, tcpreplay will ignore the snaplen field and instead try to send
packets based on the original packet length.  Bad things may happen if
you specify this option.
.TP
.BR \-L " \fInumber\fP, " \--limit "=" \fInumber\fP
Limit the number of packets to send.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 1
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:

.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 1
.sp
When trying to send packets at very high rates, the time between each packet
can be so short that it is impossible to accurately sleep for the required
period of time.  This option allows you to send multiple packets at a time,
thus allowing for longer sleep times which can be more accurately implemented.
.TP
.BR \--netmap
Write packets directly to netmap enabled network adapter.
.sp
This feature will detect netmap capable network drivers on Linux and BSD
systems. If detected, the network driver is bypassed for the execution
duration, and network buffers will be written to directly. This will allow
you to achieve full line rates on commodity network adapters, similar to rates
achieved by commercial network traffic generators. Note that bypassing the network
driver will disrupt other applications connected through the test interface. See
INSTALL for more information.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \--pid
Print the PID of tcpreplay at startup.

Load options from \fIrcfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI--no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.SH OPTION PRESETS
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The \fIhomerc\fP file is "\fI$$/\fP", unless that is a directory.
In that case, the file "\fI.tcpreplay_editrc\fP"
is searched for within that directory.
.SH "SIGNALS"
tcpreplay understands the following signals:
.sp
.IR "\fBSIGUSR1\fP"
Suspend tcpreplay
.sp
.IR "\fBSIGCONT\fP"

.SH "BUGS"
tcpreplay can only send packets as fast as your computer's interface,
processor, disk and system bus will allow.

Packet timing at high speeds is a black art and very OS/CPU dependent.  

Replaying captured traffic may simulate odd or broken conditions on your
network and cause all sorts of problems.

In most cases, you can not replay traffic back to/at a server.

Some operating systems by default do not allow for forging source MAC
addresses.  Please consult your operating system's documentation and the
tcpreplay FAQ if you experience this issue.
